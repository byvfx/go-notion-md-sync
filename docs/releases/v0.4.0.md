# v0.4.0 - Critical Pull Bug Fix

## üêõ Major Fix: Pull Command Now Extracts Content Properly

This release fixes a critical bug where the `pull` command was only extracting metadata from Notion pages instead of the actual page content, resulting in nearly empty markdown files.

### What Was Broken
- `notion-md-sync pull` would create markdown files with only frontmatter metadata
- Page content (paragraphs, headings, lists, etc.) was not being converted to markdown
- Users would get empty files despite having content in their Notion pages

### What's Fixed
- **üîß Complete Block Structure Rewrite**: Rebuilt the Notion API block handling from scratch
- **üìÑ Proper Content Extraction**: Pull command now correctly extracts all text content from Notion blocks
- **üéØ Type-Safe Block Parsing**: Replaced error-prone interface{} casting with proper typed structs
- **üîÑ Python Parity**: Go implementation now matches the working Python version's approach

### Technical Details
- **Fixed Block struct**: Removed incorrect `json:",inline"` and added proper typed fields for each block type
- **Rewrote BlocksToMarkdown converter**: Now directly accesses typed block fields (`block.Paragraph.RichText`)
- **Improved text extraction**: New `extractPlainTextFromRichText()` function works with proper Notion API types
- **Added support for**: Paragraphs, headings (H1-H3), lists, code blocks, quotes, and dividers

### For Existing Users
**Critical Update Required**: This is a major fix that completely resolves the empty file issue.

**Reinstall to get the fix:**
```powershell
# Windows
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync/main/scripts/install-windows.ps1 | iex

# Linux/macOS  
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync/main/scripts/install-unix.sh | bash
```

**Test your pull commands:**
```bash
cd your-project-directory
notion-md-sync pull --verbose  # Should now extract full content!
```

### Supported Notion Block Types
- ‚úÖ **Headings**: H1, H2, H3 with proper markdown conversion
- ‚úÖ **Paragraphs**: Full text content with formatting preservation
- ‚úÖ **Lists**: Both bulleted and numbered lists
- ‚úÖ **Code Blocks**: With language syntax highlighting
- ‚úÖ **Quotes**: Blockquote formatting

This fix ensures the complete bidirectional sync experience that was originally intended. Pull operations now work as expected, matching the functionality of the proven Python implementation.
