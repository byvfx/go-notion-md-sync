# Release Notes v0.14.0 - Performance & Concurrency Release

**Release Date:** July 27, 2025
**Type:** Major Performance Enhancement

## üöÄ **Major Performance Improvements**

### **Concurrent Processing Integration**
- **2x Performance Improvement**: Pull operations now process multiple pages simultaneously
- **Scalable Worker Pools**: Automatically adjusts worker count (5-10) based on page count
- **Better Resource Utilization**: Overlapping API calls maximize network throughput during I/O wait times

### **Timeout Optimization**
- **Extended Timeout**: Increased from 30 seconds to 10 minutes for large syncs
- **API Response Analysis**: Identified Notion API as bottleneck (some pages take 40+ seconds)
- **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful handling of slow API responses

## üîß **TUI Enhancements**

### **Configuration Integration**
- **Fixed Config Discovery**: TUI now properly finds and loads configuration files
- **Interactive Credential Setup**: Press 'c' to configure Notion token and parent page ID
- **Real-time Status Updates**: Live progress reporting during sync operations

### **Command Integration**
- **Full CLI Integration**: All CLI commands now work seamlessly in TUI
- **Init Command**: Press 'i' to initialize new projects with sample files
- **Sync Commands**: 'p' for pull, 'P' for push, 's' for bidirectional sync

### **Progress Reporting**
- **Terminal Management**: Fixed text corruption during sync operations
- **Captured Output**: Proper stdout/stderr handling prevents UI corruption
- **Progress Indicators**: Clear status updates for long-running operations

## üìä **Performance Benchmarks**

### **Before v0.14.0 (Sequential Processing)**
- **3 pages**: ~34+ seconds (11.3 seconds per page average)
- **Single-threaded**: Pages processed one at a time
- **Timeout Issues**: 30-second timeout caused failures

### **After v0.14.0 (Concurrent Processing)**
- **14 pages**: 1m 14.9 seconds (5.35 seconds per page average)
- **Multi-threaded**: 5-10 concurrent workers
- **Robust Timeouts**: 10-minute timeout handles large syncs

### **Performance Improvement**
- **~2x faster** per-page processing
- **Better scalability** for large workspaces
- **Higher reliability** for slow network conditions

## üêõ **Bug Fixes**

### **TUI Fixes**
- Fixed config file discovery preventing pull operations
- Fixed text movement when switching panes
- Fixed progress text corruption during sync
- Fixed init command hanging in TUI
- Fixed terminal state after sync completion

### **Sync Engine Fixes**
- Fixed timeout errors for large page syncs
- Fixed import cycle issues with concurrent processing
- Fixed frontmatter type handling
- Fixed progress reporting during concurrent operations

## üîç **Technical Details**

### **Concurrent Architecture**
```go
// Simple goroutine-based worker pool
workerCount := 5 // Default, scales based on page count
pageJobs := make(chan pageJob, len(pages))
results := make(chan syncResult, len(pages))

// Workers process jobs concurrently
for i := 0; i < workerCount; i++ {
    go e.syncWorker(ctx, pageJobs, results)
}
```

### **Performance Analysis Tools**
- Added `test_simple_performance.go` for API vs code benchmarking
- Added `test_concurrent_performance.go` for concurrent testing
- Identified Notion API as primary bottleneck (91,944x slower than our code)

## üìà **Performance Test Results**

```
üîç Simple Performance Analysis: API vs Our Code
üìä API Performance: 34.4 seconds total
üìä Our Code Performance: 374 microseconds total
üéØ CONCLUSION: API is 91,944x SLOWER than our code
```

## üõ† **Breaking Changes**
None - this release maintains full backward compatibility.

## üìã **Migration Guide**
No migration required. All existing configurations and workflows continue to work.

## üéØ **Recommendations**
- **Update to v0.14.0** for significant performance improvements
- **Use TUI** for better user experience with real-time progress
- **Large Workspaces**: Benefit most from concurrent processing
- **Slow Networks**: 10-minute timeout prevents sync failures

## üöÄ **Getting Started**

### **Installation**
```bash
# Download latest release
curl -L https://github.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync/releases/download/v0.14.0/notion-md-sync-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz

# Or build from source
git clone https://github.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync.git
cd go-notion-md-sync
go build -o notion-md-sync ./cmd/notion-md-sync
```

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Initialize project
./notion-md-sync init

# Configure credentials (interactive)
./notion-md-sync tui  # Press 'c' to configure

# Pull from Notion (now 2x faster!)
./notion-md-sync pull
```
