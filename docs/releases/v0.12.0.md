# Release Notes - v0.12.0

**Release Date:** July 16, 2025  
**Major Milestone:** Terminal User Interface (TUI) Implementation

## Overview

Version 0.12.0 introduces a comprehensive Terminal User Interface (TUI) that provides an intuitive, visual way to interact with notion-md-sync. This release represents the completion of Phase 4 from the project roadmap and brings us significantly closer to the v1.0 milestone.

## New Features

### Terminal User Interface (TUI)

**Command:** `notion-md-sync tui`

The TUI provides a split-pane interface that matches the original design mockup:

- **Left Pane - File Browser**
  - Interactive file listing with sync status indicators
  - File selection with visual markers
  - Status icons: synced, modified, error, pending, conflict
  - Statistics showing file counts by status

- **Right Pane - Sync Status**
  - Real-time sync operation monitoring
  - Tree-style progress display
  - Elapsed time tracking
  - Daily sync statistics

- **Header Section**
  - Application title and version
  - Notion workspace connection status

- **Footer Section**
  - Keyboard shortcuts and help text

### Navigation and Controls

- **Tab**: Switch focus between file list and sync status panes
- **Arrow Keys**: Navigate within the active pane
- **Space**: Select/deselect files for sync operations
- **s**: Initiate sync for selected files
- **c**: Open configuration view
- **q / Ctrl+C**: Quit the application

### Design Features

- Clean, professional interface with straight borders
- Focused pane highlighting with colored borders
- Responsive layout that adapts to terminal size
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Technical Implementation

### Architecture

- Built using the Bubble Tea framework for robust terminal UI
- Implements proper Model-View-Update (MVU) pattern
- Modular component design for maintainability
- Type-safe message passing between components

### Package Structure

```
pkg/tui/
├── model.go          # Main TUI application model
├── unified.go        # Split-pane unified view
├── filelist.go       # File browser component
├── syncstatus.go     # Sync status component
├── dashboard.go      # Dashboard component
├── config.go         # Configuration component
├── search.go         # Search component
├── conflict.go       # Conflict resolution component
└── *_test.go         # Comprehensive test suite
```

### Dependencies

- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea` - Terminal UI framework
- `github.com/charmbracelet/bubbles` - UI components
- `github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss` - Styling and layout

## Quality Assurance

### Testing
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for all TUI components
- Integration tests for keyboard navigation and state management
- Cross-platform compatibility testing

### Code Quality
- Zero linter violations (golangci-lint)
- Proper error handling throughout
- Clean separation of concerns
- Documented public APIs

## Breaking Changes

None. The TUI is an additive feature that doesn't affect existing CLI functionality.

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed import issues in TUI package structure
- Resolved type assertion errors in model updates
- Corrected file selection indicator display

## Performance

- Efficient rendering with minimal CPU usage
- Responsive interface even with large file lists
- Memory-efficient component lifecycle management

## Documentation Updates

- Updated CLI help text to include TUI navigation instructions
- Added comprehensive TUI documentation
- Updated project README with TUI usage examples

## Migration Guide

No migration required. Existing workflows continue to function as before. The TUI can be accessed via:

```bash
notion-md-sync tui
```

## Known Limitations

- File operations are currently mock data (real integration pending)
- Configuration interface is placeholder (full implementation in next release)
- Search functionality is placeholder (planned for v0.13.0)

## What's Next

The next release (v0.13.0) will focus on:
- Real file system integration with the TUI
- Enhanced configuration management interface
- Search functionality implementation
- Advanced sync operation controls

## Contributors

This release represents significant progress toward the v1.0 milestone, implementing the complete TUI experience as outlined in the project roadmap.
