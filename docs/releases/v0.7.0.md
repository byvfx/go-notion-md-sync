# v0.7.0 - Enhanced User Experience & Visibility

## üéØ Major Features: Configuration Verification & Enhanced Pull Visibility

This release significantly improves the user experience by adding essential verification tools and making sync operations more transparent. Users can now easily verify their setup is ready and see exactly what's happening during pull operations.

### ‚úÖ New Verify Command

**Check if your setup is ready to sync:**
```bash
notion-md-sync verify
```

**Example output when properly configured:**
```bash
‚úÖ Configuration Status: READY
   Parent Page ID: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
   Markdown Root: ./docs
   Sync Direction: bidirectional
   Conflict Resolution: diff
```

**Example output when configuration has issues:**
```bash
‚ùå Configuration Status: INCOMPLETE
   - Missing Notion API token
   - Missing parent page ID

Please create a configuration file to use notion-md-sync.
See config.example.yaml for reference.
```

#### üîç What Verify Checks

- **Configuration File**: Validates config.yaml exists and is properly formatted
- **Required Settings**: Ensures all essential fields are present
- **API Token**: Verifies Notion integration token is configured
- **Parent Page ID**: Confirms target Notion page is specified
- **Directory Settings**: Validates markdown root directory configuration
- **Sync Settings**: Shows current sync direction and conflict resolution strategy

### üìä Enhanced Status Command with Parent Page Context

**See file status with Notion context:**
```bash
notion-md-sync status
```

**Example output:**
```bash
On parent page: My Project Documentation

Changes not staged for sync:
  (use "notion-md-sync add <file>..." to stage changes)

        modified: docs/api-guide.md
        modified: docs/user-manual.md
        deleted:  docs/old-notes.md

Changes staged for sync:
  (use "notion-md-sync reset <file>..." to unstage)

        staged:   docs/overview.md
        staged:   docs/quickstart.md

Use "notion-md-sync push" to sync staged changes to Notion.
```

#### üè∑Ô∏è New Status Features

- **Parent Page Title**: Shows the actual title of your Notion parent page (not just "On branch main")
- **Real-time Fetching**: Dynamically retrieves page title from Notion API
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully handles cases where page can't be fetched
- **Context Awareness**: Provides immediate context about which Notion workspace you're syncing with

### üìà Dramatically Improved Pull Command Visibility

**Enhanced pull operations with detailed progress:**
```bash
notion-md-sync pull --verbose
```

**Example output for pulling all pages:**
```bash
Pulling all pages from Notion parent page: 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000
Found 3 pages under parent 123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000

[1/3] Pulling page: Project Overview
  Notion ID: abc123-def456-789012
  Page title: Project Overview
  Saving to: docs/Project Overview.md
  ‚úì Successfully pulled

[2/3] Pulling page: API Documentation
  Notion ID: def456-ghi789-012345
  Page title: API Documentation
  Saving to: docs/API Documentation.md
  ‚úì Successfully pulled

[3/3] Pulling page: Getting Started Guide
  Notion ID: ghi789-jkl012-345678
  Page title: Getting Started Guide
  Saving to: docs/Getting Started Guide.md
  ‚úì Successfully pulled

‚úì Pull completed successfully
```

**Example output for pulling a single page:**
```bash
Pulling page from Notion...
  Page ID: abc123-def456-789012
  Output: docs/my-document.md
  Page title: Project Overview

‚úì Successfully pulled page to docs/my-document.md
```
