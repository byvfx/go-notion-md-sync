# Release v0.10.1 - Bug Fix: Nested Page Pulling

**Release Date:** July 2, 2025  
**Type:** Bug Fix Release

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

### Fixed: Pull Command Not Fetching Nested Sub-Pages

**Issue:** The pull command was failing to fetch nested sub-pages from Notion workspaces, only retrieving direct children of the parent page.

**Root Cause:** An infinite loop bug in the `buildFilePathForPage` function's safety check logic was causing timeouts during recursive page fetching.

**Solution:**
- Fixed infinite loop by implementing proper cycle detection using a `visited` map
- Enhanced error handling with warnings for missing parent pages and cycle detection
- Improved recursive logic for parent traversal in nested page hierarchies

**Impact:**
- ✅ Successfully pulls deeply nested page structures (e.g., Page → Sub Page 1 → Sub Page 2)
- ✅ Creates proper nested directory structure mirroring Notion hierarchy
- ✅ Eliminates timeout issues during pull operations
- ✅ Maintains correct frontmatter with notion_id, timestamps, and titles for all pages

## 📁 Directory Structure Support

The pull command now correctly creates nested directories that mirror your Notion page hierarchy:

```
docs/
├── Main Document.md
├── Main Document/
│   ├── Sub Page 1.md
│   └── Sub Page 1/
│       └── Sub Page 2.md
└── Another Document/
    └── Nested Page.md
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

**Files Modified:**
- `pkg/sync/engine.go` - Fixed `buildFilePathForPage` function with proper cycle detection
- Added comprehensive safety checks to prevent infinite loops
- Enhanced logging for debugging nested page issues

**Testing:**
- Verified with multiple nested page structures
- Tested with 3 main pages each containing 2 levels of sub-pages (9 total pages)
- Confirmed proper file path construction and directory creation

## 📋 What's Included

This release focuses exclusively on the critical bug fix for nested page pulling. All other functionality remains unchanged from v0.10.0.

**Previous Features (v0.10.0):**
- Extended Notion block support (images, callouts, toggles, bookmarks, dividers)
- CSV/Database integration with full import/export capabilities
- Enhanced markdown features (LaTeX math equations, Mermaid diagrams)
- Advanced conflict resolution system

## 🚀 Upgrade Instructions

1. **Update to v0.10.1:**
   ```bash
   # Download latest release
   curl -L https://github.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync/releases/download/v0.10.1/notion-md-sync-linux-amd64.tar.gz | tar xz
   ```

2. **Test nested page pulling:**
   ```bash
   notion-md-sync pull
   ```

3. **Verify nested directory structure:**
   Check that sub-pages are properly organized in subdirectories matching your Notion hierarchy.

## 💡 Next Steps

- Consider organizing your Notion workspace with clear hierarchies to take advantage of nested directory support
- Use the pull command to maintain local copies of complex document structures
- Report any issues with deeply nested page structures on GitHub
