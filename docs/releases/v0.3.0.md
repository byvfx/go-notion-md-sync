# v0.3.0 - Configuration Bug Fix

## 🐛 Critical Fix: Automatic .env File Loading

This release fixes a critical issue where `.env` files created by `notion-md-sync init` weren't being automatically loaded, causing "notion.token is required" errors even when credentials were properly configured.

### What's Fixed
- **🔧 Automatic .env Loading**: Environment variables from `.env` files are now automatically loaded before config validation
- **📁 Smart File Discovery**: Searches for `.env` files in current directory, parent directories, and `~/.notion-md-sync/`
- **🔄 Seamless Experience**: Commands now work immediately after running `notion-md-sync init` and editing `.env`

### For Existing Users
If you're experiencing config errors after v0.2.0 installation:

**Reinstall to get the fix:**
```powershell
# Windows
iwr -useb https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync/main/scripts/install-windows.ps1 | iex

# Linux/macOS  
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/byvfx/go-notion-md-sync/main/scripts/install-unix.sh | bash
```

**Then test your existing project:**
```bash
cd your-project-directory
notion-md-sync pull --verbose  # Should now work!
```

### Technical Details
- Added automatic `.env` file loading using the existing `gotenv` dependency
- Environment variables are loaded before config validation
- Backwards compatible with manual environment variable setting
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

This fix ensures the seamless "install → init → use" experience that was intended in v0.2.0.
