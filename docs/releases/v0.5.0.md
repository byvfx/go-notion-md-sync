# v0.5.0 - Git-like Staging Workflow & Major Improvements

## 🚀 Major Features: Git-like Staging + Critical Fixes + Performance Boost

This release represents the biggest advancement since launch, introducing a revolutionary Git-like staging workflow alongside critical bug fixes, comprehensive testing, and significant performance improvements. This transforms notion-md-sync into a professional-grade tool suitable for production workflows.

### 🎯 New Git-like Commands

**Check what's changed:**
```bash
notion-md-sync status
# Output:
# Changes staged for sync:
#   staged:    docs/ready-file.md
# 
# Changes not staged for sync:
#   modified:  docs/updated-file.md
#   new file:  docs/new-file.md
```

**Stage files for sync:**
```bash
notion-md-sync add docs/file.md       # Stage specific file
notion-md-sync add docs/              # Stage all files in directory  
notion-md-sync add .                  # Stage all changed files
notion-md-sync add *.md               # Stage with patterns
```

**Unstage files:**
```bash
notion-md-sync reset docs/file.md     # Unstage specific file
notion-md-sync reset .                # Unstage all files
```

**Push only staged changes:**
```bash
notion-md-sync push                   # Push only staged files
notion-md-sync push docs/file.md      # Auto-stage and push specific file
notion-md-sync push --dry-run         # Preview what would be pushed
```

### 🧠 Intelligent Change Detection

- **Hybrid Detection**: Fast timestamp checking with SHA256 hash verification for accuracy
- **Performance Optimized**: Only calculates hashes when timestamps suggest changes
- **Reliable Tracking**: Persistent `.notion-sync/` directory stores file states
- **Auto-Update**: Smart timestamp updates prevent unnecessary future hash calculations

### 🔄 Enhanced Push Behavior

- **Staging-First**: Push now only syncs staged files (no more accidental syncs!)
- **Auto-Staging**: Specific file pushes automatically stage the file first
- **Success Tracking**: Successfully pushed files are automatically unstaged
- **Partial Failure Handling**: Failed pushes remain staged for retry

### 📊 Comprehensive Status Display

- **Color-Coded Output**: Green for staged, red for modified/new
- **Clear Instructions**: Helpful hints for next steps
- **File Categories**: Staged, modified, new, and deleted files clearly separated
- **Summary Messages**: Git-like guidance for common workflows

### 💾 Persistent State Management

- **`.notion-sync/` Directory**: Stores staging index and file tracking data
- **JSON Index**: Human-readable staging state storage
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Successful syncs automatically update tracking
- **Cross-Session**: Staging state persists across CLI sessions

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- **Type-Safe Staging**: New `staging` package with proper error handling
- **Memory Efficient**: Incremental file processing prevents memory issues
- **Path Handling**: Robust relative/absolute path conversion
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of file access issues

### 📈 Workflow Examples

**Basic staging workflow:**
```bash
# See what's changed
notion-md-sync status

# Stage files you want to sync
notion-md-sync add docs/important.md docs/update.md

# Preview the sync
notion-md-sync push --dry-run

# Sync to Notion
notion-md-sync push
```

**Selective staging:**
```bash
# Stage only specific files
notion-md-sync add docs/chapter1.md docs/chapter2.md

# Unstage one file
notion-md-sync reset docs/chapter2.md  

# Push remaining staged files
notion-md-sync push
```

### 🎉 Developer Experience

This brings the familiar Git workflow to Notion sync:
- **Predictable**: Only staged files sync, no surprises
- **Controlled**: Choose exactly what changes to publish
- **Efficient**: Skip unchanged files automatically
- **Professional**: Industry-standard version control patterns

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

- **Push behavior**: `notion-md-sync push` now only pushes staged files
- **New default**: Staging is now the default workflow (not opt-in)
- **Migration**: Existing users should run `notion-md-sync add .` to stage all files

## 🐛 Critical Bug Fixes

### Fixed: Code Blocks Empty Content
**CRITICAL FIX**: Code blocks were appearing in Notion but with no content inside.

**What was broken:**
- Fenced code blocks (`` ```language ``) showed up as empty blocks in Notion
- Only the language label appeared, but no actual code content
- Affected all programming languages and code examples

**What's fixed:**
- **🔧 Rewrote Code Block Extraction**: Implemented proper AST content extraction for fenced code blocks
- **💻 Full Content Preservation**: Code blocks now sync with complete source code intact  
- **🎯 Language Detection**: Enhanced language mapping (js→javascript, py→python, 70+ languages)
- **✅ Notion Validation**: Automatic language validation with fallback to "plain text"

**Testing Impact**: All code examples now appear correctly in Notion with proper syntax highlighting.

### Fixed: Sync Performance Issues  
**Major performance improvements for large documents and many files.**

**What was improved:**
- **⚡ Parallel Block Deletion**: Replaced sequential deletion with 5-worker concurrent processing
- **🚀 Optimized Update Process**: Reduced delays and improved block handling efficiency
- **📊 Performance Results**: 
  - Large documents (400+ lines): **4.5 seconds** (fast)
  - Small documents now process without corruption
  - Pull operations: **2-3 seconds** consistently

**Technical details:**
- Implemented `bulkDeleteBlocks()` with worker pools
- Added proper error handling for undeletable blocks
- Optimized sequential fallback for reliability

## 🧪 Comprehensive Testing Suite

- **`pkg/config/`**: 6 test cases covering configuration loading, environment variables  
- **`pkg/staging/`**: 5 test cases covering staging workflow, change detection
- **`pkg/markdown/`**: 4 test cases covering frontmatter, file parsing

## 🎯 Enhanced Markdown Support

### Improved Code Block Handling
- **70+ Programming Languages**: Comprehensive language detection and mapping
- **Smart Aliases**: Common abbreviations automatically mapped (js→javascript, py→python)
- **Syntax Preservation**: Code formatting preserved exactly from markdown to Notion
- **Fallback Handling**: Unknown languages default to "plain text" with content intact

### Better Block Processing  
- **H4+ Support**: Headers above H3 automatically convert to H3 (Notion's limit)
- **Rich Text Handling**: Improved bold, italic, and inline code processing
- **List Improvements**: Enhanced bulleted and numbered list conversion
