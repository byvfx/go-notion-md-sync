# v0.6.0 - Interactive Conflict Resolution

## üéØ Major Feature: Interactive Conflict Resolution with Diff Display

This release introduces a comprehensive conflict resolution system that brings professional-grade merge handling to notion-md-sync, making bidirectional synchronization safer and more intuitive.

### üîÑ New Conflict Resolution Features

**Interactive Diff Display:**
```bash
# When conflicts are detected during bidirectional sync:
Conflict detected in docs/important.md
--- Local (Markdown)
+++ Remote (Notion)
@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
 # Important Document
 
-This is the local version with my changes
+This is the Notion version with team updates
 
 Some shared content here...

Choose resolution: [l]ocal, [r]emote, or [s]kip? 
```

**Multiple Resolution Strategies:**
```yaml
# In config.yaml
sync:
  conflict_resolution: diff  # Options: diff, newer, notion_wins, markdown_wins
```

### üé® Resolution Strategies Explained

1. **`diff` (Default)**: Shows unified diff and prompts for user choice
   - Color-coded output: additions in green (+), deletions in red (-)
   - Clear visual representation of differences
   - Interactive prompts with intuitive options

2. **`notion_wins`**: Automatically uses Notion version for all conflicts
   - Best for teams where Notion is the source of truth
   - No prompts, fully automated resolution

3. **`markdown_wins`**: Automatically uses local markdown version
   - Ideal for individual workflows where local edits take priority
   - Preserves all local changes without prompts

4. **`newer`**: Uses timestamp comparison (falls back to diff if equal)
   - Smart timestamp-based resolution
   - Handles edge cases gracefully

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features

- **Non-Destructive**: Original content preserved until resolution confirmed
- **Skip Option**: Ability to skip individual conflicts and handle manually
- **Clear Context**: Shows exact differences before any changes
- **Atomic Operations**: Each conflict resolved independently

### üìä Technical Implementation

- **Unified Diff Algorithm**: Uses `github.com/sergi/go-diff` for accurate diffs
- **Smart Detection**: Only triggers on actual content differences
- **Performance**: Efficient diff computation even for large documents
- **Cross-Platform**: Works identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux

### üíª Usage Examples

**Basic bidirectional sync with conflicts:**
```bash
# Run bidirectional sync
notion-md-sync sync --verbose

# When conflict detected:
# 1. Review the diff showing exact changes
# 2. Choose [l]ocal, [r]emote, or [s]kip
# 3. Continue with remaining files
```

**Configure automatic resolution:**
```bash
# Always prefer Notion version
notion-md-sync sync --conflict-resolution notion_wins

# Always prefer local markdown
notion-md-sync sync --conflict-resolution markdown_wins
```

**Set default strategy in config:**
```yaml
sync:
  direction: bidirectional
  conflict_resolution: diff  # Your preferred default
```

### üéØ When Conflicts Occur

Conflicts are detected when:
- Local markdown has been edited since last sync
- Notion page has been modified by another user/device
- Bidirectional sync attempts to reconcile both changes

The system automatically:
1. Detects content differences during sync
2. Generates a unified diff for review
3. Presents clear resolution options
4. Applies chosen resolution and continues

### üöÄ Workflow Benefits

- **Team Collaboration**: Safe bidirectional sync for shared documents
- **Multi-Device**: Work across devices without fear of overwrites
- **Transparency**: See exactly what changed before deciding
- **Flexibility**: Choose resolution strategy per-project needs
- **Efficiency**: Batch operations with per-file conflict handling

### ‚ö° Performance Impact

- **Minimal Overhead**: Diff generation only when needed
- **Fast Comparison**: Optimized content comparison algorithms
- **Memory Efficient**: Streaming diff generation for large files
- **Concurrent Processing**: Other files continue syncing during prompts

This release makes notion-md-sync suitable for complex team workflows and multi-device scenarios where conflict resolution is critical. The interactive diff display ensures you never lose important changes while maintaining full control over the resolution process.
