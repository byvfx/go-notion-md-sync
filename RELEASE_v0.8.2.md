## 📈 Quality Metrics

### Before v0.8.2
```
Test Coverage: ~40% (existing packages only)
Go Report Card: C (gofmt: 0%, other issues)
Untested Packages: notion, cli, sync/engine
Critical Gaps: API client, CLI commands, core sync
```

### After v0.8.2
```
Test Coverage: 74.0% (comprehensive coverage)
Go Report Card: A+ (100% across all categories)
Fully Tested: All critical packages covered
Foundation: Production-ready reliability
```

## 🔄 Backward Compatibility
